title: "SWIFT VulnLabs - Setting Up a Vulnerable Lab Environment"
---

After using HackTheBox and VulnHub as learning resources, I wanted to create my own vulnerable network where students could connect remotely and learn how to exploit machines that were student made or machines that were regarded as good learning resources. I will be using an ESXi server, AWS EC2

I used [NetSecFocus' Trophy Room][vm-list] as a resource since I also wanted this to be a place where I could practice for the OSCP before attempting. 

# [](#header-1)The Setup

## Design

{: refdef}

I'm using an Amazon EC2 instance to setup a SSH reverse tunnel to the VPN located in the lab network but this can also be done using other methods.

# [](#header-2)AWS Setup

After setting up an Amazon Cloud account I made an t2.micro Amazon Linux 2 AMI that falls under Amazon's "free tier." The only thing that needs to be enabled on this machine is SSH as it's only being used as a bridge to the VPN that resides in our lab network.

If you haven't made an SSH key-pair yet it can be done with:

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```
It's important to ensure that this key is secure and is backed with a strong password as we are exposing SSH to the entire world.

# [](#header-3)VPN Setup

I am currently using a Ubuntu 18.04 image running Pritunl for the VPN. The Ubuntu machine will be running in the same network as the vulnerable machines.

## [](#header-3)Pritunl
The official Pritunl documentation can be found [here][pritunl-link] and i've included the commands to install on Ubuntu 18.04 below.
```
sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-4.2.list << EOF
deb https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu bionic/mongodb-org/4.2 multiverse
EOF

sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pritunl.list << EOF
deb https://repo.pritunl.com/stable/apt bionic main
EOF

sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv E162F504A20CDF15827F718D4B7C549A058F8B6B
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv 7568D9BB55FF9E5287D586017AE645C0CF8E292A
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get --assume-yes install pritunl mongodb-server
sudo systemctl start pritunl mongodb
sudo systemctl enable pritunl mongodb
```
After Pritunl starts, the setup will then move to the web interface which will be running on localhost and should prompt you to run these commands
```
sudo pritunl setup-key

sudo pritunl default-password
```
{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![asset](/assets/img/pritunl_setup.png)
{: refdef}

Once it has been setup, add a Server with desired settings and then create and attach an Organization.

In this scenario, I am using port 15161/tcp as I am going to be using a reverse SSH tunnel through my Amazon EC2 instance.

## [](#header-3)Reverse SSH Tunnel
We're going to be using a reverse SSH tunnel to make our VPN publicly accessible through the Amazon EC2 instance. The command to do this is below, which will forward the port 15161 that Pritunl is using to the EC2 instance and open that to the public.

By default, this will not work and a change will need to be made to /etc/ssh/sshd_config to enable GatewayPorts. To do this uncomment or add the line to the sshd_config file
```
GatewayPorts yes
```
```
ssh -i ssh_key -R 0.0.0.0:15161:localhost:15161 ec2-user@x.x.x.x
```

All that's left is to download the OpenVPN config for the user and change the ip to the public ip of the Amazon EC2 instance. When connecting through OpenVPN, it will connect to the EC2 instance and then tunnel through Pritunl into the lab network.

Any vulnerable machines that reside on the network should now be able to be interacted with.
